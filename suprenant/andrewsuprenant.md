# Andrew Suprenant (18F Product) management readme

## Welcome!

This is intended to introduce me as a person, answer some likely questions, and set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker. 

This is not laying out any hopes or any expectations for you or plans for any work we might have together. 

## Background
 - I joined the 18F Product Chapter in March 2016 and am on a four-year term through March 2020. I was thrilled to join and am thrilled to be part of this organization
 - I like to make complex or involved products with teams of people. This could look like a web app, website, documentary, or other work somewhere on the spectrum of media and technology. Whatever the format, my goal is to make people's lives a little easier, clearer, efficient, or meaningful
 - I was born and raised in Kankakee, Illinois, and have lived in Chicago with bits in Montreal and San Francisco 
 - I have a niece and a nephew
 - I like reading, movies, and fitness (boxing, running, yoga)
 
### Why 18F?
 - I have mostly worked in the private sector but have done a lot of work for nonprofits and had one project that intersected with the Departemnt of Energy. I knew some people that worked in the White House and Department of State, and their work sounded really interesting to me. I then heard Paul Smith talk about the Healthcare.gov rescue. At the end of his talk, he made a pitch for USDS and 18F, neither of which I had heard off. A lightbulb went off, and here we now are. I really like our mission of helping the government better serve the public through more effective use of technology. 
 
### Things I've done here so far
I've worked on a variety of engagements wiht a diverse set of partners. I served as team lead unless noted:
 - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau eProcurement discovery and prototyping
 - cloud.gov (Customer team lead)
 - Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board TSP.gov consulting using US Web Design System 
 - Department of Labor 14(c)
 - U.S. Navy NAVAIR path analysis 
 - U.S. Air Force Recruiting service path analysis
 - U.S. Forest Service Open Forest
 - Federalist (contributing member)

I'm also an Agile Guild lead (#g-agile in TTS Slack). I was one of our Infrastructure leads for awhile and learned a lot about security, compiance, and buying software within the federal government. 
 
### Personal goals
 - Serve effectively in the Product Chapter, delivering outcomes that advance our partner missions and support our organization
 - Serve in a supervisory role to help set standards and grow our Product team
 - Share out how we work and lessons learned to our orgnization, other groups in goverment, as well as to the public
 - Continue to find ways to support other parts of TTS (e.g. Centers of Excellence, Office of Products and Platforms)
 - Spend more time in D.C.

### Once my time here has done
 - Sabbatical 
 - I will possibly attend grad school, including programs that mix public policy/admin and data science
 - I forsee a mix of public and private sector work over my career. I like to teach, consult, and write, so I expect to do a mix of that as well
