This isn’t
Laying out
	My expectations for you
	My plans for our organization and its products


A quick way to
	Introduce me as a human
	Answer some likely questions
	Set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker


Things to know
I live in Chicago by myself. I have a girlfriend, a niece, and a nephew
I was born and raised in Kankakee, IL, and have lived in Chicago with bits in Montreal and SF
I like X

On feedback
I love feedback
Feedback is critical to my success here
Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
Benefit should be high (positive results)
Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions

I will find time to talk with you


Why 18F?

Known Failure Modes
I'm likely to be reticent to express opinions about what/how you should be doing (But I'll never demur in the face of a direct question or request for advice)

Firm on vision
Flexible on details

Improving how we perform regularly
While accepting who we are

Disagree then commit
Argue like you’re right, but listen like you’re wrong. Instead of arguing to win, you can argue to learn. You have to acknowledge when your opponent makes a good point

Assume best intent
Know how many bullets you have
Never waste a good crisis
Simplify, and add lightness

Set tough standards and hold people accountable
Tough minded on standards
Tenderhearted with people

We say what’s on our mind
We don’t expect anyone else to read our mind

Just because something is hard isn’t an excuse not to do it.

Someone who starts a message in Slack with just a wave makes my head explode

1. What are your preferences in terms of how you like to communicate?
2. What are your priorities?
3. What are your pet peeves?
Putting work on my plate you could do yourself 

I tend to be busy
Tend to trust my team

Blaise/Andrew notes


Don’t brainstorm well in Slack
Happy to chat a bit, but if the context is new or subject matter complex, let's start a doc, find time to meeting, and talk through what you've found

I don't like reading between the lines. I can't read minds. Tell me what's up
FWIW I’m a big believer in calling out potential issues early, often, and with escalating loudness
Address little issues before they become big issues

Love books/articles
Discussing philosophy of approach
Kind of lazy/don't like wasting time so will spend a fair amount of time thinking and working on ways to make regular activities more efficient 

Highly organized, fights for team
May give team more space than is useful, scope went wide


For team that I am on (could be good when starting projects regularly)
If you're working on something significant, write it down
Write down process and context
Story by story, rather than team member by team member


I want us to push hard to get everyone the tools we need and also stay focused on what we can do with what we do have available at a given moment

I need to be able to write a written summary of something new before I can really understand it. Takes a bit of time

Energy management
Productivity over presence

I will say that I have a pretty strong preference in naming issues as `Thing we are making` versus `Process by which we make that thing` – e.g. “Research plan” vs. “Write a research plan”, keeping us focused on the thing of value we are making and leaving room for how exactly we might choose to produce them (which we can write in the acceptance criteria or implementation steps)

If we’re talking about an issue, let’s put our notes in the issue whenever possible 
One more – if we're talking about a specific issue (especially if the comms is an update or something more cut and dry), I find it really helpful if we default to the Github issue for communication around this so that issue can be the source of truth for that piece of work. Of course, we may want to sometimes discuss things faster and in finer detail in Slack, but if we can generally make the issue the default, that would be helpful.


10:30AM ET? Assuming so, but writing it down helps my brain convert time zones
Turn the ship around

BLUF (bottom line up front)
Let’s get to the point
Also, if you want to wave and send request/message, please do both at the same time :)

Slack w/threads
Quick Hangout if topic gets substantial 
Daily standup
Feedback please! (working on giving and receiving)


One thing I will also ask is that if we are having a team meeting, we stay focused on the team meeting and don't do other work/unrelated Slack/etc. Kathryn, I know it could be a bit different for you since you span several projects, but if we're going to set time aside to work together, I would love us to stay focused on that. 

If we are ever not using time well, let's call that out versus drifting to other stuff. 


I learn better by reading than watching videos

I like a ton of autonomy

Pretty 9-5, typically take a lunch at noon
Central time
Areas where I'm learning: strategy, data. Consulted for a long time so still getting use to rhythms/pace/norms of working for another place
I don’t say guys
I may say y’all

I _always_ start from a position of doubt!
And excitement too
But I want to consider where this could go off the rails
And then mitigate for that

Avoid meetings on Monday and Fridays, before/after travel 
I don’t like meeting over lunch
I tend to work better from home 


I am going to give you feedback, and I expect you will give it to me as well so we can both learn and grow

"Only do what only you can do"
Marquet quotation

https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe
He’s an internal thinker who is sometimes quieter in large groups.

Promotion
Talk to Michael and Will
Outline goals and user manuals
Could also talk to them about career goals (CDS, Netflix)

questions I’ve asked:
What brings out the best in me?
What brings out the worst in me?
What do you see as my strengths and weaknesses?
What are my blind spots?
If tomorrow was your first day working with me, what information about my personality would help you work with me more effectively?


Precision. Need to tell me if I'm being pedantic
Slow, let me know, but if you don't and it's not pressing, you can assume I'm working on it.

Areas I've been working on
Trainings
Coach

Putting in the bit of effort that makes things easier for everyone

Things that are signs that we have failed:
 - What should I do?
 - Where is [X] information

Kniberg

Writing that has influenced my thinking:
 - _Turn the Ship Around!_ - L. David Marquet
 - _You Will Be Satisfied_ - Bob Tasca    
 - _Nonviolent Communication_ - Marshall Rosenberg
 - _Eleven Rings_ - Phil Jackson
 - _The Inner Game of Tennis_ - Timothy Gallwey
