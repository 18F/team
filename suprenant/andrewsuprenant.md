**Management readme**

This is intended to:
 - Introduce me as a person
 - Answer some likely questions
 - Set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker

This isn’t:
 - Laying out my expectations for you
  - Laying out my plans for our project

Things to know:
 - I joined the 18F product chapter in March 2016 and am an Agile Guild lead
- I live in Chicago by myself
 - I have a girlfriend, a niece, and a nephew
 - I was born and raised in Kankakee, IL, and have lived in Chicago with bits in Montreal and SF
 - I like reading, movies (and made them in a past life), and yoga

On feedback
 - I love feedback
 - I believe every day is a day for feedback, and if we withhold it, we withhold opportunities for our teammates to grow
 - I will give you feedback and expect you to do the same for me
 - If there's ever something that feels like it's getting in the way of giving effective feedback, let me know
 
 Why 18F?
 - Via ORD Camp, I heard Paul Smith talk about the Healthcare.gov rescue. At the end, he made a pitch for USDS and 18F, neither of which I had heard off. A lightbulb went off, and here we now are

 - Firm on vision, flexible on details
 - Just enough process to keep things moving

Where I can fall down:
 - I'm likely to be reticent to express opinions about what/how you should be doing (But I'll never demur in the face of a direct question or request for advice)
 - Starting a message in Slack with just a wave or "hey"...

Working principles:
BLUF (bottom line up front) – let’s get to the point (or acknowledge that we're just catching up)
- Set tough standards and hold people accountable
- Improving how we perform regularly while accepting who we are in the present 
 - Disagree then commit
 - Argue like you’re right, but listen like you’re wrong. Instead of arguing to win, you can argue to learn. You have to acknowledge when your opponent makes a good point
 - Assume best intent
 - Use your bullets well. Know they are typically finite in number
 - Never waste a good crisis
 - Simplify, and add lightness
 - Just because something is hard isn’t an excuse not to do it
 - Productivity over presence. If we're meeting together, let's focus on the meeting

Collaborating:
If you're talking about a time zone other than Central, please let me know
Highly organized because I believe this saves time in the long run, and I also find it enjoyable
Tend to put a lot of thought into feedback, which makes the feedback typically useful but can take time. If you want something from me quickly, tell me up front
- I will find time to talk with you
 - He’s an internal thinker who is sometimes quieter in large groups. 
 FWIW I’m a big believer in calling out potential issues early, often, and with escalating loudness
Address little issues before they become big issues
May give team more space than is useful, scope went wide
Like working on ways to make regular activities more efficient 
 - Contrarary to what I feel is our thinking here, I want you to interrupt me if you have stopped listening to what I'm saying. I of course want to make sure I'm being heard clearly, but it doesn't do either of us good to talk if the other person has stopped listening for whatever reason.
 - I work from home pretty often. I have been thinking of how I can spend more time in DC but haven't figured that out yet

Schedule
 - Pretty 9-5, typically take a lunch at noon. Usually working an hour before or after that but avoid meetings then.
 - When possible, I avoid meetings on Monday and Fridays, before/after travel 


Agile stuff
For team that I am on (could be good when starting projects regularly)
If you're working on something significant, write it down
Write down process and context
Story by story, rather than team member by team member


Goals
 - Promotion, Product lead or Director role
 - Likely go back to private sector after this and then back to public sector
 - I'm interested in grad school, including programs that mix public policy/admin and data science



Also, if you want to wave and send request/message, please do both at the same time :)
I don't like reading between the lines. I can't read minds. Tell me what's up

Don’t brainstorm well in Slack
Happy to chat a bit, but if the context is new or subject matter complex, let's start a doc, find time to meeting, and talk through what you've found

I need to be able to write a written summary of something new before I can really understand it. Takes a bit of time

Energy management




Slack w/threads
Quick Hangout if topic gets substantial 
Daily standup
Feedback please! (working on giving and receiving)


Product management
 - Estimates
 - Repos more than wikis
 - WIP limits
 - I will say that I have a pretty strong preference in naming issues as `Thing we are making` versus `Process by which we make that thing` – e.g. “Research plan” vs. “Write a research plan”, keeping us focused on the thing of value we are making and leaving room for how exactly we might choose to produce them (which we can write in the acceptance criteria or implementation steps)

If we’re talking about an issue, let’s put our notes in the issue whenever possible 
One more – if we're talking about a specific issue (especially if the comms is an update or something more cut and dry), I find it really helpful if we default to the Github issue for communication around this so that issue can be the source of truth for that piece of work. Of course, we may want to sometimes discuss things faster and in finer detail in Slack, but if we can generally make the issue the default, that would be helpful.

One thing I will also ask is that if we are having a team meeting, we stay focused on the team meeting and don't do other work/unrelated Slack/etc. Kathryn, I know it could be a bit different for you since you span several projects, but if we're going to set time aside to work together, I would love us to stay focused on that. 

If we are ever not using time well, let's call that out versus drifting to other stuff. 

I like a ton of autonomy
I learn better by reading than watching videos
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

I _always_ start from a position of doubt!
And excitement too
But I want to consider where this could go off the rails
And then mitigate for that

I am going to give you feedback, and I expect you will give it to me as well so we can both learn and grow

I want us to push hard to get everyone the tools we need and also stay focused on what we can do with what we do have available at a given moment

Areas I've been working on (including with a GSA coach, which has been invaluable):
 - Giving feedback
 - Presentation skills
 - Energy management 
 - Tone and presence

Things I'm learning about/working on:
- Strategy (I've recently led two path analysis engagements and have learned a lot here)
- Data analytics (I recently attended The Data Science Conference in Chicago). Also considering grad school in this area
- Development (I recently attended Strange Loop in St. Louis)

Things that are signs that we have failed:
 - What should I do?
 - Where is [X] information
